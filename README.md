`astiav` is a Golang library providing C bindings for [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg)

It's only compatible with `ffmpeg` `n5.1.2`.

Its main goals are to:

- [x] provide a better GO idiomatic API
    - standard error pattern
    - typed constants and flags
    - struct-based functions
    - ...
- [x] provide the GO version of [ffmpeg examples](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/n5.1.2/doc/examples)
- [x] be fully tested

# Examples

Examples are located in the [examples](examples) directory and mirror as much as possible the [ffmpeg examples](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/n5.1.2/doc/examples).

# Install ffmpeg from source

If you don't know how to install `ffmpeg`, you can use the following to install it from source:

```sh
$ make install-ffmpeg
```

`ffmpeg` will be built from source in a directory named `tmp` and located in you working directory

For your GO code to pick up `ffmpeg` dependency automatically, you'll need to add the following environment variables:

(don't forget to replace `{{ path to your working directory }}` with the absolute path to your working directory)

```sh
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L{{ path to your working directory }}/tmp/n5.1.2/lib/",
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I{{ path to your working directory }}/tmp/n5.1.2/include/",
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="{{ path to your working directory }}/tmp/n5.1.2/lib/pkgconfig",
```

# Why astiav?

After maintaining for several years the most starred [fork](https://github.com/asticode/goav) of [goav](https://github.com/giorgisio/goav), I've decided to write from scratch my own C bindings to fix most of the problems I still encountered using `goav`.
